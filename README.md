rutoken-manager
===============

A PyQt front-end for Crypto Pro CSP for CentOS 6 and GosLinux by The Federal Bailiffs' Service of Russia

The application requires following packages to be installed before you use it(for x86_64 architecture)
PyQt4, rtSupCP-64, cprocsp-rdr-pcsc-64, lsb-cprocsp-capilite-64

If you have installed all those packages, you are able to run <b>python rutoken-manager.py</b> to use it.

Rutoken-manager was desinged for GosLinux(not gOS) distribution, but also tested on Linux Mint 17. In theory it can work on any EL6 or Ubuntu-based distribution.

There is also SPEC-file for building a rpm-package in this repository.
